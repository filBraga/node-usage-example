// Semver versions

// Specifically, ^1.1.1 indicates that you want to use any version that is compatible with 1.1.1, up to, but not including, the next major version.

// ^1.1.1 means any version that is 1.1.1 or higher but less than 2.0.0. It allows for updates within the same major version, so it will include versions like 1.1.2, 1.2.0, 1.3.5, etc., but not versions like 2.0.0 or 1.0.0.
